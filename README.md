# To Do Or Not To Do

To Do Or Not To Do is an application where the user can create different lists with tasks. Each task can be marked as completed or uncompleted, and it is possible to add and remove tasks from the diffferent lists. The user can upload a profile picture and the app shows the user which tasks are due soon.
